  <h2>üåà Middle East: LGBTQIA+ Rights, History, and Realities</h2>

  <article>
    <h3>üìú Overview</h3>
    <p>
      The Middle East is one of the most challenging regions worldwide for LGBTQIA+ individuals. Laws criminalizing same-sex activity range from imprisonment to the death penalty. Social stigma, state surveillance, and religious conservatism create a climate of fear. However, underground resistance, brave activists, and a growing international network keep hope alive.

    <h3>üèõ Historical Context</h3>
    <details>
      <summary>Pre-Islamic Cultures and Ancient Traditions</summary>
      <p>
        Ancient Middle Eastern civilizations such as Sumer, Babylon, Persia, and others had varied understandings of gender and sexuality. Some mythologies and texts reveal fluid gender roles and same-sex relationships, though often complex and context-dependent. For example, certain Mesopotamian religious rituals may have included third-gender priesthoods.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Classical Islamic Period</summary>
      <p>
        Early Islamic societies had mixed attitudes. Classical Islamic law (Sharia) did criminalize same-sex acts, but historical records also reveal poetry, literature, and anecdotes expressing homoerotic themes. The strictness of enforcement varied widely across regions and periods.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Modern Era: Colonial and Post-Colonial Influence</summary>
      <p>
        European colonial powers introduced or reinforced criminal laws against homosexuality in many parts of the Middle East. Post-colonial regimes often maintained or intensified these laws. Political authoritarianism, religious fundamentalism, and cultural conservatism increased persecution, especially after the late 20th century.

  <details>
    <summary>üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà Historical and Cultural Context</summary>
    <p>
      South Asia has a complex history regarding gender and sexuality. Pre-colonial societies exhibited diverse and fluid understandings of gender and same-sex relations. Ancient texts and temple carvings in India reference various non-binary genders and same-sex desire, such as the <em>Kamasutra</em> and the <em>Hijra</em> communities ‚Äî transgender and third-gender individuals with recognized social roles.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the arrival of British colonial rule introduced Victorian-era anti-sodomy laws (like Section 377 in India) that criminalized homosexual behavior, imposing strict heteronormativity. These laws heavily influenced post-independence legal systems, continuing to oppress LGBTQ+ communities for decades.

      <li><strong>Pakistan:</strong> Homosexuality remains criminalized under colonial laws with punishments including imprisonment; trans people face some legal recognition and a 2018 law protecting transgender rights exists, but societal discrimination is intense.</li>
      <li><strong>Bangladesh:</strong> Same-sex activity illegal, punishable by imprisonment; transgender community recognized in some social spaces but faces severe stigma and violence.</li>
      <li><strong>Nepal:</strong> Progressive constitution recognizes sexual and gender minorities; third gender option available on IDs; no same-sex marriage, but vibrant LGBTQ+ activism.</li>
      <li><strong>Sri Lanka:</strong> Same-sex relations criminalized; transgender people face discrimination; slowly growing activism.</li>
